= Random polyfill performance

All tests were run on 64 bit PHP 7.4 except for native.

== Engines

* Native: PHP 8.2 extension
* `brick/math` abandoned extension-less version based on the `brick/math` package
* GMP (pure): GMP based Math implementation with native fallback disabled
* GMP (with native): GMP based Math implementation that uses regular PHP math when int size allows
* `arokettu/unsigned` (pure): `arokettu/unsigned` based Math implementation with native fallback disabled
* `arokettu/unsigned` (with native):  `arokettu/unsigned` based Math implementation that uses regular PHP math when int size allows

Time in tables is milliseconds for 10000 iterations
